# Introduction :
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. There is no one absolute way to prescribe the exact steps in the data cleaning process because the processes will vary from dataset to dataset.
# Data Cleaning :
The steps are as follows :-
1. Remove duplicate or irrelevant observations
2. Fix structural errors
3. Filter unwanted outliers
4. Handle missing data
# Advantages and benefits of data cleaning
1. Removal of errors when multiple sources of data are at play.
2. Fewer errors make for happier clients and less-frustrated employees.
3. Ability to map the different functions and what your data is intended to do.
4. Monitoring errors and better reporting to see where errors are coming from, making it easier to fix incorrect or corrupt data for future applications.
5. Using tools for data cleaning will make for more efficient business practices and quicker decision-making.
